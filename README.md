# ðŸ§¾ TaxSave Assist â€“ Predicting Canadian Tax Refunds with Machine Learning

TaxSave Assist is a machine learning project that predicts whether a Canadian taxpayer will receive a tax refund â€” and estimates the refund amount â€” using CRA-style financial features such as Income, RRSP contributions, Tuition credits, and Dependents.

This end-to-end ML pipeline demonstrates both classification and regression techniques, along with SHAP explainability to bring transparency to financial predictions.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- âœ… Built a **synthetic dataset** simulating 1000+ tax scenarios
- âœ… Applied **Random Forest Classifier** to predict refund eligibility (Yes/No)
- âœ… Trained **Random Forest Regressor** to estimate refund amount
- âœ… Achieved **F1-score: 0.97** and **RÂ² score: 0.95**
- âœ… Used **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** for model explainability
- âœ… Visualized feature importance, SHAP summary plots, and force plots
